# Optical character recognition

This program reads from images and other file types and then determines what to name the file.
You simply set the rule (how you wish files to be named) and then select the files you wish to rename.

First the program lets you choose the directory you wish to work in. You can always switch directories later.

When you choose the directory the window displays all the files in the folder. You can read from the file using Optical Character Recognition and you can rename the file.

There is also an option to set the rule for file naming, to avoid retyping data into the field.
First you click the button "new rule" which then shows you the text from the document and there you enter the desired name based on the document.
Later you simply select the file and press "apply rule" which will apply the same rule as the one you set (I chose a unique number in each file).
